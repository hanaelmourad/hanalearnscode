    <h2>GitHub Is Your Best Friend</h2>
    <p>The first time I ever worked or even heard of GitHub was earlier this semester when my one of professors announced that we will be collaborating on our code through Github as part of our group assignment. That statement was enough to send me in a panic. I am just a girl who wants to up her digital game, but I have no ambitions of becoming a developer. GitHub seemed out of my league. Even the lexicon felt too serious. All this talk about commits and pull requests made everything seem so final. </p>
    <p>Eventually, I managed to get over my fear and followed the class lecture with this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv8rSLsi1xo&t=290s"> tutorial.</a> which made everything seem a bit easier but not any less threatening. When I was working on my group project, I was treading carefully around GitHub and GitHub Desktop and was very relieved when I was done with assignment. I had told myself then that the possibility of me working with GitHub again will be very minimal. Fast-forward, a few weeks later, I was working on my portfolio project and the issue of hosting came along. As I have decided not to go with a CMS platform, that meant  that I have to self-host my website. I went online to study my options only to find that GitHub has a feature called GitHub Pages that allows you to host your website for free. I was intrigued but still very cautious.</p>
    <p>Next, I move to YouTube- my favorite solo-learning platform because you could almost always find someone who explains things in a way that makes sense to you and for me and GitHub, it was this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA_c3bGQXlQ&t=217s"> tutorial</a> that made me realize how simple it would to host my website on that platform. It is a simple as creating a repository and uploading your code then going the GitHub Pages tab and choose that option. It is insanely easy and pretty straightforward. And despite a few newbie mistakes here and there, my website was up and running in under 5 minutes. So if you are having any doubts about GitHub, I guarantee you that you will find it to be very user-friendly.</p>
    <p>This was a solo project so it meant I could not really benefit from the collaborative aspect of GitHub. But, what I found extremely helpful is the way GitHub traces all your steps and allows you to see all the changes you have a made as well as compare side by side different version of your code. By the end of this project, I felt very willing to 'commit' to GitHub as my new found code partner and I hope that you do too.</p>
