					<p>The journey to these very pages that you are now browsing is documented as part of a course assignment. I am very excited as I write those first lines. Full disclosure: I am a journalist who has never kept a blog and I am glad that a university assignment pushed me in this direction. As part of my Advanced Master in Digital Humanities, I enrolled in a course called Online Publishing which aims to give the students tools to be able to publish content on the web. Under the context of this course, we’ve been asked to write a blog about a ‘web publishing related technique that you want to learn, and make the blog posts such that other students can learn from your blog.</p>

					<p>Sounds pretty straightforward, right? Truth is, it took almost 70% of the semester to decide on a topic. I was continuously and frequently doing research and looking at different skills that I am interested in acquiring. The end of the semester was nearing so was the deadline and I still had not made a choice.  I looked at <a href="https://idyll-lang.org/docs">Idyll</a> which is a markup language that “can create explorable explanations, write data-driven stories, and add interactivity to blog engines and content management systems’ which would be a perfect addition to my growing arsenal of data journalism skills. However, after 2 weeks of trying to work with it, it proved to be a steep learning curve which would be all that harder to surmount with the lack of documentation on Idyll.</p>

					<p>One late night, while mindlessly watching videos on auto-play, YouTube suggests to me a video where a web developer reviews personal portfolio websites and my mind was blown! Seeing these videos linked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7V0-QvYbdo">here</a>  and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZqzhmlTkAc">here</a> , and I was completely at awe with not only the talent and creativity of those developers but also the amazing powerful effects and animations that can be done with relatively simple code (HTML, CSS, and JS vs. hardcore scripting languages such as Java. My interest in frontend development spiked. I felt that these are conversations the developers are having with their users. . I started looking at different CMS’ that offer ready-made templates such as WordPress, Wix and Drupal, but I felt that 1- I was already very familiar with those platforms due to my previous work and/or studies, and 2- although they offer a lot of different templates and plugins, they are also limiting in terms of creative freedom. The more I thought about it, the more I moved away from the idea of using a ready CMS template and more in the direction of building something with less constraints. Moreover, the idea of having a portfolio website started becoming more of a necessity than a perk. Soon, the idea started forming in my head. I will work on creating a portfolio website that focuses on animations and movement with the help of HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript.</p>

					<p>To start, I built on previous knowledge of HTMl and my newly acquired CSS and JS modest skills thanks to a couple of courses that I have taken this year.To start, I built on my previous knowledge of HTML and my new acquired CSS knowledge from a couple of courses that I have taken this year. As with all web development projects, I started with a new folder and an index file. And as with all web development punch lines, I went with a hello world theme because why not? Earlier during the semester, I had worked practiced a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MgpE2DTTKA&t=253s">tutorial</a>  that focuses on video backgrounds so I decided to use it as my landing page.
						The Hello World page inspired the look and feel of the entire website: minimalistic modern design with clean smooth animations to entice and entertain the visitors of the website with its content as well as showcase to them my skill set.After finalizing the landing page which will serve only as bridge to get to the real blog/portfolio page, I created a new file that will be my home page. I started styling it, adding divs and containers, nav bar, etc.…

					<p><p>As I built my blog block by block with the help of w3schools tutorials, I realized that styling it and getting it to where I wanted will take a ridiculous amount of time especially if I wanted to include a lot of animated content. My eyes then turned to w3schools templates and I started using the "Try it yourself" feature and customized the existing code to reflect what I wanted while being able to immediately see the results without having to create local files. Soon, I found myself googling 'cool css button templates' and to my surprise, there was an endless amount of websites, open source databases, forums, and individuals who offer their entire code for people to learn from, reuse, and even improve on! Yes, it is a simple as copying and pasting the code and "Ta Da!", your code is suddenly doing magic! But, at the same time, I had a voice in my head that kept on screaming: "But what about plagarism?" Isn't the whole 'copy/paste' method frowned upon in this World? The answer is, when it comes to open source code, the answer is no! The world's entire (open) code is your oyster. Learn more with me about code reusability and why it is very important in our world in the <a href="blog2.html">next</a> post.</p>
