            <p><strong>Welcome to the last blog of this series. As I write those words, I can confidently say that I have accomplished the task that I had set out at the beginning of this assignment, which is learning a new skill that will benefit in the 'real world'. It has been definitely an exiting and rewarding experience but not without its difficulties. I have become very comfortable working with HTML and CSS. Javascript still seems a few steps ahead. I also have become much more familiar in the GitHub environment.
                But, above all, I now know how to navigate the world of solo-learning and understand the significance of utilizing existing knowledge to expand my set of skills but also the world of possibilities.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>To be honest, at first, I wondered why we are made to write a blog about learning a new skill. I mean, I am a university student- all I am doing is learning new things. However, contrary to the newly acquired skills from school, the assignment aims to reinforce the importance of solo-learning with the help of online tutorials and documentation.
                But, it also wants to highlight the monumental amount of content available to us online. And, that is exactly my take away from this assignment: the world wide web is for everyone, it is up to you to grab what you need and learn from it, like the <a href="https://templatemo.com/live/templatemo_510_letter">template</a> for this page that I found on templatemo! Always be mindful of copyrights. While a lot of code is available for use, remember to link or credit the source. And most importantly, do not reproduce for commercial purposes. </strong></p>

            <p><strong>If someone told me less than a year ago that I will be able to create a personal portfolio website that looks this cool, I would've probably shrugged them off.
                While I do believe that I am generally a fast learner, I wouldn't have imagined that I will be able to understand code, let alone write it.   That being said, one important lesson I learned this year, it is that everything product you make is just an iteration, and it is your job to seek to constantly improve upon it. There are a lof of aspects that make me proud of this portfolio. But, there is a number of elements that are missing or need improvement. For instance, the website loads slow because of the heaviness of the animations and photos that load at the same time. Another thing would be better links, breadcrumbs and nav bar to make the website more user friendly. Moreover, a couple of the animations need to be optimized for mobile.
                The world is changing fast, and the needs to stay current and relevant in today's job market is to be highly agile and adaptable.So, if you're worried about getting a job, developing an app, or just finishing an assignment, lean on the world of open source. Learn from one of the most collaborative communities in the world. Don't wait until you sign up for a course, just start now. If I can do it, you most definitely can! Thank you for reading this far and I hope that you will come back in a while to my <a href="landing.html">blog.</a> </strong></p>
