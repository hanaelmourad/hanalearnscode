        <p><em style="font-size:110%;">Starting up this project was a very slow process. But, the more tutorial I followed, the faster things went. I started exploring animations and templates, practiced more exercises. I even created challenges for myself. Truth be told, sometimes adapting someone else's code to yours would take way more time than you actually doing the world yourself instead of spending hours trying to debug or reading the documentation.
           For the main page, I started with the Ring of Fire animation that I followed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avo71iW9mI4&t=0s">a tutorial.</a> but I made it my own. I changed some of the properties of the animation to give it a more futuristic feel. It took a lot of trial and error to understand how the animations worked but once I got the right combination, I was so excited and wanted to do more.</em></p>

            <cite>— Ryan Donovan - Stack Overflow</cite></inner></blockquote>



        <p>In a Stack Overflow <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/05/20/good-coders-borrow-great-coders-steal/">blog post</a>, Ryan Donovan ponders the same open source dilemma. He explains: "Copying code from Stack Overflow is a form of code cloning; that is, duplicating code from within a project or between projects and reusing it." He compares using pre-written code to using "a variety of frameworks and plugin libraries that simplify development". Building on Picasso's famous quote: "Good artists borrow, great artists steal" (as a programmer would with great code), Donovan proclaims: "Good coders borrow, great coders steal".As a beginner, and even as a pro, be very mindful when cloning code. Test it and retest it a few times. Run it on different browsers and machines. The main goal is to create code that is as clean and bugfree as possible. So, sometimes bulky code could stand in the way of that.</p>


        <p><a href="https://hanaelmourad.github.io/hanalearnscode/landing.html">My main page</a> for example is build on top of a great template I found by accident on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcskp-ncN0I">YouTube.</a> while looking for how to build a responsive portfolio website. I decided to use this template as a starting point to build my profile. I ended up re-watching this video at least 3 times while trying to follow all the different steps. While there are a few parts where I feel I need to put more effort and practice into, (for instance the glowing ring on the main page is mobile responsive but it overlaps on the text once the window is converted to mobile), overall I felt a huge improvement in just how fast I could locate a mistake by following a number of methods from the inspect feature on the browser (which I have grown very fond of) to following the right naming conventions when declaring values or amending already existing code. I also tried to make it my own as much as possible by not using most of the already existing styling and CSS sheets. </p>

        <p>Like that super dramatic Parallax effect that you see on to of this page. I mean, I am no art critic, but this is some genius code right there. This awesome code I also found through a tutorial but you probably already know that. Fair to say though, that I have practiced a few times. And while I cannot replicate it without assitance, I feel more familiar with the syntax of CSS and how things actually work.</p>

        <p>What you probably don’t know, is the list of resources that I will share wil you below. Before moving on to my next <a href="blog4.html">post</a>, about GitHub, It is a list that I have compiled over the course of 2 months and finding each of those websites felt like hitting the jackpot. One of my favorite finds (which might be old news for you, so bear with me), is Codepen.io. What is amazing about this website is the editor that you can use to try out the code yourself without even leaving the website saving you a lot of time and allowing you to understand what each function or snippet of code does. </p>
